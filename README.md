# HackerRank Stuff

My solutions to hackerrank problems and a small cli to make downloading material easier.

## Notes

At the moment there is only one command which will download and store the files for challenges under "challenges" in your current working directory. The path of the files are based off the "track" that hackerrank uses to group their challenges.

### Running

An example command could look something like this...

```
node . fetch --challenge count-triplets-1 --language javascript
```
